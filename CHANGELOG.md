## [Unreleased]

## [2.3] - 2021-07-13
### Changed
- Updated reMarkable physical screen dimensions based on official specs
  from the display manufacturer.  This should technically be slightly more
  correct.  It's a difference of only a hundredth of an inch, though, so
  it shouldn't really look that different in practice.

## [2.2] - 2021-04-06
### Added
- Landscape templates for the 2mm and 3mm metric templates

## [2.1] - 2021-04-04
### Changed
- Adjusted the positioning of lines in the templates to align with the
  pixels on the reMarkable's screen.

## [2.0] - 2021-04-03
### Changed
- Templates are now generated by a program from a short list of
  parameters, in place of the old handmade SVGs.

## [1.0] - 2021-04-01
### Added
- Initial public release
